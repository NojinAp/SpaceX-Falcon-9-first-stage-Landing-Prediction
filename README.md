# SpaceX-Falcon-9-first-stage-Landing-Prediction
<h1>Business Problem</h1>
<p align="justify">In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; While other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

Here is an example of a successful launch:

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. SpaceX performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

<h1>Objective</h1>
To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
